Prompts:
Can you help me fix a chart in HTML that's not rendering correctly in different browsers (Premier League Standings)
How can I optimize this chart's layout for accessibility and screen readers (all league standings)
Limit all text to only English keyboard characters, no special characters (all names with special characters)
